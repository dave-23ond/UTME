    <i>History Of Jamb For 1978-2021</i>
    <p>Establishment of JAMB (1978):<br><br>

   - Before the establishment of JAMB, each university in Nigeria conducted its own entrance examinations for admission.<br>
   - This decentralized system led to various challenges, including inconsistencies in the admission process and difficulties for students applying to multiple universities.<br><br>

   - JAMB was established on February 13, 1978, following the promulgation of the JAMB Act.<br>
   - The establishment was a response to the need for a unified and standardized system for university admissions in Nigeria.<br><br>

   - JAMB was given the mandate to coordinate the admissions process into Nigerian tertiary institutions, including universities, polytechnics, and colleges of education.<br>
   - The goal was to ensure fairness, equity, and transparency in the selection of candidates for higher education.<br><br>

   - JAMB introduced the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) as a standardized entrance examination for prospective university students.<br>
   - The UTME aimed to provide a common evaluation metric for all candidates, regardless of the university they applied to.<br><br>

   - With the establishment of JAMB, a more centralized and coordinated admission system was put in place.
   - This helped streamline the admissions process and created a more organized and transparent system for selecting candidates.<br><br>

   - JAMB's establishment significantly contributed to a more uniform and standardized approach to university admissions in Nigeria.<br>
   - It addressed the challenges associated with multiple entrance exams and provided a fair and efficient mechanism for assessing candidates.<br><br>

Over the years, JAMB has undergone various changes and implemented reforms to adapt to the evolving educational landscape in Nigeria. The establishment of JAMB marked a crucial step toward creating a more unified and accessible higher education system in the country.</p>
